# Hello there, I'm Brandon Harrelson! üëã

## About Me üìù
Highly resourceful and technically skilled professional with proven expertise in software development, automation, scripting, and more. I began my journey as a Pipefitter Helper and presently work as a Python Developer at Odyssey Analytics. Along the way, I developed a keen eye for troubleshooting and problem-solving in the IT space, earning a six-week internship program in data science. To further augment my skills, I enrolled in an intensive Data Science Program at Practicum USA.

My accomplishments include a series of certificates from Coursera and Udemy, which helped me to hone my knowledge in key areas such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, sci-kit-learn, and MySQL. My core competencies lie in database maintenance, data visualization, automation & scripting, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

Currently open to new opportunities and willing to participate in outsourcing projects. If my profile resonates with you, feel free to get in touch. Open to relocation.
